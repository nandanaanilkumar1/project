# project
This project utilizes Multivariate Linear Regression to predict real estate prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. By applying the Ordinary Least Squares method and correlation analysis in Python, I modeled the impact of 13 variables on property value. The model’s accuracy was validated using R-squared and Mean Squared Error metrics.
